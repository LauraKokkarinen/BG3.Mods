## Blood Divination

The Blood Divination subclass is a homebrew spec I am playing on a tabletop DnD campaign. It is otherwise the same as the regular Diviner subclass, except that the level 6 subclass feature [Expert Divination](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Expert_Divination) is replaced by a custom subclass feature called _Sanguine Infusion_.

> **Sanguine Infusion**: _You've learned to weave your life force into the spells you cast, boosting their intensity at the cost of your vitality. You can choose to take 1d6 Necrotic damage per the spell's level instead of using a spell slot._

Credit for the subclass icon goes to [Dragonify03](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Dragonify03) and their [Icons for Modded Subclasses](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4216) mod on Nexus Mods. The icon was originally created for a subclass called Arcanist (Exploiter) but I found it to be suitable for Blood Diviner as well.

If you wish to edit the mods, you can use the Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit to do so. If you have installed Baldur's Gate 3 via Steam, you can find the toolkit in your Steam library under Tools. YouTube has plenty of modding tutorials to get you started.

To effortlessly synchronize the local mod files with the GitHub repository, create symbolic links between the repo directories and the four local modding directories. You can do that by running the following commands (after updating them with your local paths) from the command line with admin privileges. You need to do this individually for each mod you wish to edit.
